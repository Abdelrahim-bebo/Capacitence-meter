# Capacitance Meter

## Overview

The **Capacitance Meter** is an embedded systems project designed to measure and display the capacitance of electronic components accurately. This project uses an AT90S2313 microcontroller from ATMEGA to process the capacitance measurements and displays the results on a 7-seg display.

## Features

- Accurate measurement of capacitance values.
- User-friendly display of measurement results on an 7-seg.
- Supports a range of capacitance values.
- Simple calibration and adjustment options.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller:** ATMEGA (e.g., AT90S2313)
- **Display:** 7-seg
- **Capacitor:** Capacitor With Any Value From Microfarad to Millifarad
- **Resistor:** 10k ohms (or appropriate value for your circuit)
- **Miscellaneous:** Breadboard, jumper wires, power supply, Latch 4094, 7-Seg, Crystal Oscillator

## Software Requirements

- **IDE:** Atmel Studio
- **Libraries:** LiquidCrystal library for seven-segment
